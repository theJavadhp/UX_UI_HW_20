                For this project, we were asked to build a modern-day mobile app
                that helps people plan their next trip for the post-pandemic
                era.

            <h5>Proto Persona</h5>
            <p>
              Before conducting the interviews, I created a prototype persona to
              better understand the target user demographic for the research
              project. This proto persona served as a foundation for the
              research and provided a clear representation of the target user,
              including their age, occupation, goals, pain points, and habits. I
              used this information to inform the design of the interview
              questions and guide the overall direction of the research project.
              By developing a proto persona, I was able to ensure that the
              research was user-centered and aimed at gathering valuable
              insights that could be used to inform the design process.

            <h5>Interviews</h5>
            <p>
              In this research project, I was responsible for the planning and
              execution of 5 interviews with potential users. The objective of
              these interviews was to gather insights and understand the needs
              and requirements of the target audience for the product being
              studied. To achieve this goal, I carefully selected and approached
              participants who were representative of the target user group. I
              developed a structured interview guide that covered relevant
              topics and ensured that all participants were asked consistent
              questions. During the interviews, I listened attentively to the
              participants, took thorough notes and recorded their responses.
              After conducting all 5 interviews, I analyzed the data to extract
              meaningful insights that informed the design of the application.

            <h5>Interview Data</h5>
            <p>
              After conducting interviews with potential users, I used the data
              collected from the interviews to create a visual representation of
              the users' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. To do this, I
              utilized affinity diagramming to organize and categorize the
              collected data. Then, using the data from the affinity diagram, I
              created an empathy map that provided a deeper understanding of the
              user's perspective by highlighting their pain points, motivations,
              goals, and habits. Finally, I synthesized the data from the
              empathy map to create a comprehensive and representative persona
              that captured the unique characteristics and needs of the
              potential user. This persona helped me to understand the user's
              context and design solutions that would meet their specific needs.

            Using these findings, I was able to identify a user insight that
            accurately represented the challenges faced by the users. I then
            used this insight to develop a problem statement that clearly
            defined the problem space and provided a direction for the design
            process. The user insight and problem statement provided a strong
            foundation for the design phase, ensuring that the solution met the
            needs of the users and addressed their pain points effectively.
